                    The RGU Anime and Manga Society is a vibrant community dedicated to celebrating and exploring the rich world of Japanese animation and graphic novels. We provide a welcoming space for students who share a passion for anime, manga, and all things related to Japanese pop culture. </br>
                    Our mission is to foster a thriving community where members can come together to appreciate, analyze, and enjoy anime and manga in all its forms. Through screenings, discussions, workshops, and social events, we aim to promote cultural awareness, creativity, and friendship among our members. We strive to create an inclusive environment where individuals from all backgrounds feel empowered to share their passion and engage in meaningful dialogue.
